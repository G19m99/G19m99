## ðŸš€ Recent Project: YouTube Clone

I recently updated my old project, YouTube Clone, with the following features:

- **Infinite-scroll**: Automatically fetch additional videos when the user reaches the end of the page for a seamless browsing experience.
- **Custom feed**: Implemented a feed algorithm that displays videos based on the user's selected categories, providing a personalized and relevant video feed.
- **Categories management**: Enhanced the ability for users to add or remove videos from the saved categories section, facilitating quick searches for videos in specific categories, which also affects the feed algorithm.

Check out the project [here](https://chimerical-banoffee-b31920.netlify.app/) to explore these new features and see how they enhance the overall functionality and user experience.
