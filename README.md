## ðŸš€ Recent Project: OpenTow

I recently built **OpenTow**, a real-time, multi-tenant dispatch SaaS platform for towing fleets with the following features:

- **Open job queue**: Drivers can browse and claim jobs from a shared queue instead of being assigned, supporting a more flexible dispatch workflow.  
- **Reactive updates**: All job status changes are synced in real time across all users using [Convex](https://convex.dev/), ensuring accurate and up-to-date info.  
- **Modern tech stack**: Built with React, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN UI components for a fast, clean, and responsive user experience.

Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/G19m99/OpenTow) to explore the code and architecture behind the app, and the demo [here](https://opentow.netlify.app)
